    <li>Select the 'Fork' button in the top right corner of the page (under your account image)</li>
    <li>The repo has now been copied into your own repos and you can work on it in your chosen IDE</li>
    <li>If you have any suggestions to make regards to the code to make the site better, you can put in a pull request</li>
    <li>In the console, run: pip install -r requirements.txt</li>
    <li>If you want to create a web-app from the repo please see "Project Deployment"</li>
</ol>
